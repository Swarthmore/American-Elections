American Elections
==================

A Wordpress theme originally intended for displaying changes to voting laws by state since 2008.

## How it works

- Categories were created for each state.
- Students created one post per state with appropriate categorization.
- When visitors click on a state or state name, a modal is triggered revealing the post.
- Visitors can also use the options to reveal color coded maps

## Future Improvements worth considering

This theme was initially written many years ago on a tight timeline. It is very likely there are better ways to handle this type of project. Among other things, the following improvements should be considered if implementing today:

- Use SVG instead of PNGs for the base maps
- Swap out map for mapping library if project goals become more complex
- HTML5 Shiv is probably no longer necessary
